## Overview
Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. This project aims to detect and classify these dark patterns in text using machine learning.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
  - `Dark_Patterns_Detection.ipynb`: Main notebook for building and training the model.
  - `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating the trained model.
- `server/`: Colab notebook serving as a server for the model.
- `frontend/`: Anvil app for the project's frontend.
- `data/`: Sample dataset for training and testing.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dark-patterns-detection.git
   cd dark-patterns-detection
