# Dark Patterns Detection

Detect and classify dark patterns in text using machine learning. This project includes a Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating the model, a Colab notebook serving as a server, and a frontend built on Anvil.

## Overview
Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. This project aims to detect and classify these dark patterns in text using machine learning.

## Project Format
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
- `server/`: Colab notebook serving as a server for the model.
- `frontend/`: Anvil app for the project's frontend.
- `data/`: Sample dataset for training and testing.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dark-patterns-detection.git
   cd dark-patterns-detection

# Temporary hosted on : https://ancient-breakable-cigarette.anvil.app/ 

## NOTE : THE APP ONLY WORKS WHEN THE SERVER IS UP AND RUNNING
